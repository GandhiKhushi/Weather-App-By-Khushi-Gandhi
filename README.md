3) User-Friendly Interface: The intuitive user interface makes it easy for users to interact with the app, creating a seamless experience for both tech-savvy individuals and those less familiar with technology.

**Tech Stack:**

Programming Language: Python
text-to-Speech (TTS): Python pyttsx3 and requests module are Used.
Weather Data API: API used for real-time weather data.

I'm proud of what the Weather Assistant App has achieved so far and look forward to further refining and expanding its capabilities. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out! 🌐
